Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning Model | Python, Machine Learning
• Data Preprocessing : Standardized the data using StandardScaler to ensure all features were on the same scale,
improving the SVM model’s performance and convergence.
• Model Selection : Built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for binary classification, chosen for its ability to
create clear decision boundaries and effective handling of high-dimensional data.
• Compared SVM with other models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to confirm SVM as
the best fit for this medical classification task.
